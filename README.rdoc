= JQuery.Placeholder-Label

This plugin enables the display of HTML5-style placeholder labels in older browsers. 

The plugin will be auto-disabled when used in a modern browser that supports HTML5 placeholders.

== Simple usage

  $('input:text[placeholder]').placeholderLabel();
  
then set a CSS style such as

  input.placeholder {
    color: #CCC;
    font-style: italic;
  }

you can set an alternate css class:

  $('input:text[placeholder]').placeholderLabel({placeholder_class: 'dull'});
